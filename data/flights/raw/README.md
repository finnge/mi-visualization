MOTIVATION

The data in this dataset is derived and cleaned from the full OpenSky
dataset to illustrate the development of air traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic.
It spans all flights seen by the network's more than 2500 members between
1 January 2020 and 1 April 2020. More data will be periodically
included in the dataset until the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.


DISCLAIMER

The data provided in the files is provided as is. Despite our best efforts at
filtering out potential issues, some information could be erroneous.

- Origin and destination airports are computed online based on the ADS-B
  trajectories on approach/takeoff: no crosschecking with external sources of
  data has been conducted. Fields <origin> or <destination> are empty
  when no airport could be found.

- Aircraft information come from the OpenSky aircraft database. Fields
  <typecode> and <registration> are empty when the aircraft is not
  present in the database.


DESCRIPTION OF THE DATASET

One file per month is provided as a csv file with the following
features:

- <callsign>: the identifier of the flight displayed on ATC screens
  (usually the first three letters are reserved for an airline: AFR
  for Air France, DLH for Lufthansa, etc.)
- <number>: the commercial number of the flight, when available (the
  matching with the callsign comes from public open API)
- <icao24>: the transponder unique identification number;
- <registration>: the aircraft tail number (when available);
- <typecode>: the aircraft model type (when available);
- <origin>: a four letter code for the origin airport of the flight
  (when available);
- <destination>: a four letter code for the destination airport of
  the flight (when available);
- <firstseen>: the UTC timestamp of the first message received by
  the OpenSky Network;
- <lastseen>: the UTC timestamp of the last message received by the
  OpenSky Network;
- <day>: the UTC day of the last message received by the OpenSky
  Network.
